🎯 Objective
Rate {{account.name}} (Website: {{account.website_url}}) on a 1–5 scale based on how closely the company fits our ICP for the Grocery vertical. Use all available information from the web and Apollo.

🔌 Inclusion Criteria
Must be a B2B company in the Grocery vertical (distributor, wholesaler, or relevant business model supplying other businesses).

Exclude DTC-only, most retailers, restaurants, cafes, companies not selling tangible goods, brokers or unrelated industries.

📊 Scoring Guidelines
1️⃣ Poor Fit: Mostly irrelevant to Grocery ICP or primarily consumer-focused.
2️⃣ Low Fit: Limited alignment; small portion of business relevant to Grocery ICP.
3️⃣ Moderate Fit: Some alignment with Grocery ICP; could be a potential prospect.
4️⃣ High Fit: Strong alignment; mostly meets ICP characteristics (e.g., grocery distributor or regional supplier serving multiple foodservice or retail clients).
5️⃣ Perfect Fit: Ideal ICP company; core business fully aligns (e.g., large grocery wholesaler supplying grocery chains, retailers, or foodservice clients).

If the company is a broker or agent that arranges sales but does not handle product or delivery, score = 1.

If the company is an importer or exporter that facilitates cross-border trade but does not manage domestic delivery, score = 1.

If the company is a 3PL or logistics provider that transports or stores goods for others but does not own the products, score = 1.

If the company is an aggregator or marketplace connecting buyers and sellers without owning inventory or managing delivery, score = 1.

If the company is a manufacturer selling only through intermediaries with no direct sales or delivery to grocery stores, score = 1.

If the company is a cold storage or warehouse provider offering space or handling but not distribution, score = 1.

If the company is a consultant, marketing firm, or technology vendor serving distributors but not performing distribution, score = 1.

If the company is a retailer or direct-to-consumer brand selling primarily to consumers, score = 1.

If the company is not a Distributor or Manufacturer of grocery store products, score = 1.

If the company is not selling tangible goods, or is a broker, score = 1.

Manufacturer without explicit direct-to-grocery-store evidence → max score = 3.

Manufacturer with direct-to-grocery-store evidence → eligible for 4.

A score of 5 represents a company whose primary function is direct-to-grocery-store distribution, selling products such as fresh/frozen produce, packaged foods, beverages, dairy, or other grocery staples.

If a Distributor/Wholesaler mainly sells to retail or wholesale intermediaries instead of directly to grocery stores or B2B customers, max score = 2.

If a company primarily acts as a partner, aggregator, or intermediary rather than selling directly to grocery stores or B2B customers, score = 1.
