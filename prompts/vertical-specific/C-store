C-store Distributor Evaluation

🎯 Objective
Evaluate {{account.name}} (Website: {{account.website_url}}) as a potential convenience store distributor. Return ONLY a single integer from 1 to 5.

🚨 **CRITICAL: Business Model Validation**
Before scoring, you MUST verify the company's primary business model by examining the website. 

**The company MUST be primarily a DISTRIBUTOR/WHOLESALER that:**
- Buys and resells physical products to convenience stores and other retail businesses.
- Handles inventory, warehousing, and logistics for these products.
- Has a B2B sales model with wholesale pricing.

**The company MUST NOT be:**
- A real estate company, investment firm, holding company, or brokerage.
- A manufacturer that only sells its own products.
- A retailer that sells directly to consumers (DTC).
- A service provider (logistics, marketing, consulting, etc.) without product ownership.

🔍 **Website Analysis Instructions**
1. Carefully read the website's homepage, "About Us", and "Services" pages.
2. Look for clear evidence of distribution operations (e.g., product catalog, wholesale pricing, logistics, warehousing).
3. If the website mentions real estate, investments, or other non-distribution activities as their primary business, disqualify immediately.

🔌 **Primary Qualification** (PASS/FAIL)
The company PASSES only if ALL are true:
- The primary business is distribution/wholesaling (not one of many divisions).
- They directly sell physical products to convenience stores or other retailers.
- They own inventory and manage logistics for these products.
- The website clearly describes distributor operations.
